  "content": "Important: Negative testing in the sandbox is in beta.\n\nNegative testing lets you force the flows through specific error conditions that you want to test to ensure you handle errors correctly. Use negative testing to trigger the following types of errors:\n\n\nErrors that result from calling a PayPal API.\n\n\nErrors related to Virtual Terminal and the \nDoDirectPayment\n operation, which relate to verification and credit card validation errors.\n\n\nYou can force two types of API errors: errors related to the transaction amount, and errors not related to the transaction amount.\nKnow before you code\nNegative testing is only available for use with the following:\n\n\nSandbox environments. You cannot force or simulate error conditions in the live PayPal environment.\n\n\nClassic PayPal API versions 2.4 and later.\n\n\nBusiness accounts.\n\n\nEnable negative testing\n\n\nGo to the \ndeveloper.paypal.com\n home page. Log into the Dashboard and select the menu below your name to select \nDashboard\n.\n\n\nUnder the \nSandbox\n heading in the left navigation column, select \nAccounts\n.\n\n\nLocate the sandbox account for which you wish to enable negative testing. Choose a business sandbox account or you won't see the options you need.\n\n\nIn the \nManage Accounts\n column, select the \n...\n symbol to display the menu choices.\n\n\nSelect \nView/Edit Account\n to see the \nAccount Details\n page that has the \nProfile\n tab selected by default.\n\n\nSelect the \nSettings\n tab to display a list of options you can set.\n\n\nSet the \nNegative Testing\n option to \nOn\n.\n\n\nThe sandbox is now in the negative testing state for transactions that include the merchant. Without this configuration, the sandbox does not raise error conditions unless the error occurs through normal transaction processing.\nTest methods\nIn the PayPal sandbox, you can pass inputs to simulate scenarios that mimic the actual API responses without calling downstream services.\nYou can use the following methods to conduct negative testing in the sandbox:\n\n\nSimulate negative responses with request headers\n.\n\n\nSimulate negative responses with test values\n.",

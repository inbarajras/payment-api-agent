The seller will see the platform fee in their transaction details as Partner commissions. Following rules apply to partner/platform fees:The currency of the platform fee must be the same as the transaction currency.To receive the money, the platform fee payee must add a bank account to their PayPal account.Partner fees are settled into the bank account attached to the PayPal account. This settlement is done once daily, so transactions with partner fees completed today will be consolidated into one payment and settled tomorrow.If a partner chooses to receive partner fees from their integration, their partner/live API-caller account cannot have a PayPal balance.Partner fees will be paid out to the bank account associated with the partner account. If the partner wants to transact with this account as a seller or collect payments directly from buyers, it will cause issues. In that case, the partner must make another account. Platform fee is not supported for first-party integrations.Use the following endpoints to set the fees and refund amounts:Set fee using /v2/checkout/orders in PURCHASE_UNITS.PAYMENT_INSTRUCTION.PLATFORM_FEES.AMOUNT. If PURCHASE_UNITS.PAYMENT_INSTRUCTION.PLATFORM_FEES.PAYEE is not set, the fee amount will go to the live API caller account.Set the refund amount during refund transactions using /v2/payments/captures/capture_id/refund in PAYMENT_INSTRUCTION.PLATFORM_FEES.AMOUNT. Partner must be enabled by PayPal to use this feature.Compare our packaged solutionsFeatures included in PayPal Checkout and Expanded Checkout.PayPal CheckoutExpanded CheckoutClient and server side integrationsAccept PayPal, Venmo, and Pay Later offersAccept alternative payment methodsOne-time sales transactionsAuth and capture transactionsVoid and refundsAdvanced credit and debit card paymentsCustom user experienceCustomizable fraud protection toolsTell us about your platformComplete this form, and a PayPal representative will contact you after they evaluate your business needs.If you are a seller or small business proprietor interested in PayPal solutions, do not complete this form.
